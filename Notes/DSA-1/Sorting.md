# 📌 What is Sorting?

Sorting is the process of arranging elements in a particular order (ascending or descending). It is a fundamental concept in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

# 📌 Why is Sorting Important?

Searching becomes faster (Binary Search requires sorted data)
Data organization for efficient processing
Used in databases, machine learning, and networking
Solving complex problems like Median finding, Closest Pair of Points, Range Queries, etc.
# 📌 History of Sorting Algorithms

- Sorting has evolved over time from simple inefficient methods to highly optimized algorithms:

Bubble Sort (1956): The simplest but slowest sorting algorithm.
Selection Sort (1959): Slightly better than Bubble Sort but still inefficient.
Insertion Sort (1959): Used for small data sets.
Merge Sort (1945, John von Neumann): Introduced divide and conquer approach.
QuickSort (1959, Tony Hoare): One of the fastest sorting algorithms in practice.
Heap Sort (1964): Uses heap data structure for sorting.
Radix Sort (1954): Used for sorting numbers in a non-comparative way.


# Bubble Sort

💡 Idea: Compare adjacent elements and swap if they are in the wrong order. Repeat until the array is sorted.

🔴 Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n²)
🟢 Best Case (Already Sorted): O(n)
⚡ Stable? Yes


# 📌 2️⃣ Selection Sort
💡 Idea: Find the smallest element and swap it with the first element, then repeat.

🔴 Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n²)
🟢 Best Case: O(n²)
⚡ Stable? No
