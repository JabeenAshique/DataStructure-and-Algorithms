# 🔎 What is Searching?
Searching is the process of finding an element in a collection (array, list, tree, graph, etc.). There are two major categories of searching algorithms:

# 📌 Types of Searching Algorithms

Linear Search (Brute Force)
Binary Search (Efficient)
Ternary Search (Optimized Binary Search)
Jump Search (For sorted data)
Exponential Search (For unbounded arrays)
Interpolation Search (For uniformly distributed data)
Fibonacci Search (Divide & Conquer like Binary Search)

# 📌 1️⃣ Linear Search (Brute Force)
💡 Idea: Traverse the array and check each element until a match is found.

🔴 Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n)
🟢 Best Case (First Element Match): O(1)
⚡ Works on: Sorted & Unsorted Arrays

# 📌 2️⃣ Binary Search (Efficient)
💡 Idea: Only works on sorted arrays. Repeatedly divide the search space into two halves.

🔴 Worst Case Time Complexity: O(log n)
🟢 Best Case: O(1)
⚡ Works on: Sorted Arrays
