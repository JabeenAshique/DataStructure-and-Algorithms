# 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Stack?
- A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.
- The last element added to the stack is the first to be removed.
- It is like a stack of plates where you can only remove the top one first.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ How to Implement Stack?
- A stack can be implemented using arrays or objects.
- It supports operations such as inserting, removing, and checking elements.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Operations of Stack
- Push: Inserts an element at the top.
- Pop: Removes and returns the top element.
- Peek: Returns the top element without removing it.
- Size: Returns the number of elements in the stack.
- IsEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.
- Sort: Sorts elements (optional feature).

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Applications of Stack
- Undo/Redo feature in text editors
- Function Call Stack (Recursion)
- Expression Evaluation (Infix to Postfix Conversion)
- Browser Back/Forward Navigation
- Balanced Parentheses Checking

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Stack Complexity Analysis
| Operation | Time Complexity |
|-----------|----------------|
| Push | O(1) |
| Pop | O(1) |
| Peek | O(1) |
| Size | O(1) |
| Sort | O(n log n) |

üìå *Key Takeaways:**
- Stacks are useful for LIFO-based operations.
- Can be implemented using arrays or objects or LinkedLsit.
- Commonly used in function calls, undo-redo, and expression evaluation.
