 # Memory Management
Memory management refers to how we manage data in memory and the different ways of optimizing memory usage.

ðŸ“Œ Real-Life Analogy:

Imagine you have a storage room (memory) where you store boxes (variables). If you donâ€™t remove unused boxes, the room fills up, making it difficult to find space for new ones. This is similar to memory leaks in programming.

ðŸ“Œ How JavaScript Handles Memory?

# JavaScript memory management consists of three phases:

- Memory Allocation â†’ When a variable is created, memory is allocated.
- Memory Usage â†’ Data is stored and manipulated in memory.
- Memory Deallocation â†’ Garbage Collector frees unused memory.

# Types of Memory Management
Static memory allocation â€“ Memory is allocated at compile time and cannot be changed later.

Dynamic memory allocation â€“ Memory is allocated at runtime, allowing flexibility.

# Types of Memory Used in Memory Management

- Stack memory â€“ Used to store primitive data types and function call executions. It follows LIFO (Last In, First Out).
  
  function example() {
    let x = 10;  // Stored in Stack
    let y = 20;  // Stored in Stack
    console.log(x + y);
    }
    example();


- Heap memory â€“ Used to store objects, arrays, and functions. It allows dynamic memory allocation.

let obj1 = { name: "Alice" };  // Stored in Heap
let obj2 = obj1;  // Reference to the same memory location
obj2.name = "Bob";

console.log(obj1.name); // "Bob" (Both point to the same object)


- Virtual memory â€“ Part of the hard disk used as extra RAM when physical memory is full.

# Memory Management Issues

- Memory leak â€“ When allocated memory is not released, causing the program to consume more memory until it runs out of space.

    let arr = [];
    setInterval(() => {
    arr.push(new Array(1000000).fill('*')); // Keeps consuming memory
    }, 1000);


- Heap overflow â€“ When new data keeps getting added without removing old data, causing memory overflow.

    function heapOverflow() {
    let arr = [];
    while (true) {
        arr.push(new Array(1000000).fill('*'));  // Keeps allocating
        }
    }
    heapOverflow();


# Garbage Collection

Garbage collection is the automatic process of freeing unused memory by removing objects that are no longer needed.

    let user = { name: "Alice" };
    user = null;  // The object is now eligible for garbage collection
