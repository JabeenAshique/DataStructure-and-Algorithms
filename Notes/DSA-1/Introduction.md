# What is Data Structure and Algorithm?

- **Data Structure** refers to a method of organizing and managing data efficiently in memory.  
  In computing, memory is a component or a device that stores data. To ensure optimal usage of memory, we organize, manage, and sort data effectively—this entire process is known as **Data Structure**.

- **Algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure or formula used to solve a problem.  
  It defines how we **manage, organize, and process** data through a structured set of instructions.

- Implementing an **algorithm** requires writing a program that follows these steps to accomplish a specific task.

# **Algorithms are often evaluated based on the following criteria:**

✅ **Time Complexity** – Measures how fast an algorithm runs.  

✅ **Space Complexity** – Measures how much memory an algorithm consumes.  

✅ **Correctness** – Ensures the algorithm produces the expected output.  

✅ **Efficiency** – Determines how well the algorithm performs under different conditions.
