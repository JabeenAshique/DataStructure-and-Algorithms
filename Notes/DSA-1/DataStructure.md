- Data is stored in memory.

- Memory is a device that stores data.

- Data can be stored in two ways:

- Contiguous Memory Allocation – Data is stored in consecutive memory locations.
- Non-Contiguous Memory Allocation – Data is stored in scattered memory locations, connected via pointers.
- To manage data in memory, two types of allocation exist:

- Static Allocation – Memory is allocated at compile-time.
- Dynamic Allocation – Memory is allocated at run-time.
- 
# Different types of memory are used for efficient data storage:
- Stack Memory – Used for function calls and local variables (LIFO).
- Heap Memory – Used for objects and dynamic memory allocation.
- Virtual Memory – Uses disk storage as an extension of RAM when physical memory is full.
  
# Memory management is important because, without it, issues occur:

- Heap Overflow – Too much dynamic memory is allocated.
- Stack Overflow – Too many function calls cause memory exhaustion.
- Memory Leakage – Unused memory is not deallocated, reducing available memory.

# To organize and manage data efficiently, we use Data Structures (DS):

- Linear Data Structures – Data is stored sequentially. (Examples: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues)
- Non-Linear Data Structures – Data is stored hierarchically or in an interconnected manner. (Examples: Trees, Graphs, Tries, Hash Tables)
- To improve the performance of data structures, we use algorithms.

Sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, recursion, and more help optimize data handling.

# Data structure is divided by two

# 1. Primitive Data Types

- These are the basic building blocks of data manipulation.
  
- Examples: Integer, Float, Character, Boolean

# 2. non -promitive data types are two

- These are more complex structures derived from primitive data types.
  
 # Further divided into two categories:

# 1.Linear Data Structures
- Data elements are arranged sequentially (one after another).
- Operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal happen in a linear fashion.
  
# Examples:
  - Array
  - Linked List
  - Stack
  - Queue

# 2.Non linear Data Structure.

- Data elements are connected in a hierarchical or interconnected manner.
  
- Useful for representing complex relationships.
# Examples:
  - Tree
  - Graph
  - Trie
  - Heap
